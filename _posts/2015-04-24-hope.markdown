### Hope


A ray of hope is a light forever
Deep down stuck in my heart forever
The sight of you was a gift together
Making my life shine together

A life for a reason
And a reason for life
Making me strong 
In every weak line

There you come to make me smile
Deep down I knew u were there to strike
U became the reason of hope in life
Making everybody else smile

Then the day came 
And I realized
Choosing you 
Was the best of mine

Thinking of failure 
I summarized
Finding a hope 
Showed a path of life

Winning together 
Was the practice of life
And Dreaming together
Became the mission of mine
