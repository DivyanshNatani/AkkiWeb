### Hope


A ray of hope is a light forever<br />
Deep down stuck in my heart forever<br />
The sight of you was a gift together<br />
Making my life shine together<br />

A life for a reason<br />
And a reason for life<br />
Making me strong<br />
In every weak line<br />

There you come to make me smile<br />
Deep down I knew u were there to strike<br />
U became the reason of hope in life<br />
Making everybody else smile<br />

Then the day came <br />
And I realized<br />
Choosing you<br /> 
Was the best of mine<br />

Thinking of failure<br /> 
I summarized<br />
Finding a hope<br /> 
Showed a path of life<br />

Winning together<br /> 
Was the practice of life<br />
And Dreaming together<br />
Became the mission of mine.<br />
