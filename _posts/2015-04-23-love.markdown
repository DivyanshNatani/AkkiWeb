### LOVE- a Destruction Or A Distraction


Claiming to be the most appealing distraction..
Creating a way of absolute destruction..
Charming as morning sunshine..
pleasing as the parky moonlight..
Way to the dreams of adoring life..
Taking to a hell with alluring rise..
To fall for the pieces of beautiful crystals..
To walk to the places of majestic immortals..
Where the life claims to be a glamorous end..
And death proves to be a hideous game..
Where sparkle in light but cry inside..
To wipe your face with a insane smile..
Together fighting with that Almighty's rage..
Always tied in closed floating cage..
