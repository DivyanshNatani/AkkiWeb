### LOVE- A Destruction Or A Distraction


Claiming to be the most appealing distraction..<br />
Creating a way of absolute destruction..<br />
Charming as morning sunshine..<br />
pleasing as the parky moonlight..<br />
Way to the dreams of adoring life..<br />
Taking to a hell with alluring rise..<br />
To fall for the pieces of beautiful crystals..<br />
To walk to the places of majestic immortals..<br />
Where the life claims to be a glamorous end..<br />
And death proves to be a hideous game..<br />
Where sparkle in light but cry inside..<br />
To wipe your face with a insane smile..<br />
Together fighting with that Almighty's rage..<br />
Always tied in closed floating cage..<br />
