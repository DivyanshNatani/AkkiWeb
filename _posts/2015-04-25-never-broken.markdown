### Never Broken
 

Shattered in the journey of dreams,
And shivered with the legacy of daydreams,

Snapped in the closest of earth
And tired in the outing of this trust,

Crippled like a crazy tired soul
and Stuck in an empty round bowl,

A mixture of ambitions and hope
fighting for the plan to my goal

Its a place where life claims to be a glamorous end
And death proves to be a hideous game

Where I am stuck for the pieces of beautiful crystals,
And I  walk to the places of majestic immortals

Here I fight with that almighty's rage
Always tied in a closed floating cage

A mere smile often wins me a token,
Nd they easily say that I'm never Broken.
