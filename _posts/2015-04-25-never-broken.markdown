### Never Broken
 

Shattered in the journey of dreams,<br />
And shivered with the legacy of daydreams,<br />

Snapped in the closest of earth<br />
And tired in the outing of this trust,<br />

Crippled like a crazy tired soul<br />
and Stuck in an empty round bowl,<br />

A mixture of ambitions and hope<br />
fighting for the plan to my goal<br />

Its a place where life claims to be a glamorous end<br />
And death proves to be a hideous game<br />

Where I am stuck for the pieces of beautiful crystals,<br />
And I  walk to the places of majestic immortals<br />

Here I fight with that almighty's rage<br />
Always tied in a closed floating cage<br />

A mere smile often wins me a token,<br />
Nd they easily say that I'm never Broken.<br />
